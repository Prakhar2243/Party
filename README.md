# Party Organization System
In this project we will provide a web-based platform to host, organize a party and send or receive
invitations as per the situation. This project is all about to reduce the human efforts in organizing
any party event. In real life it takes only 8-10 days just to prepare any outline related to the party.
So, it is not difficult to understand how hectic it would be to make everything functional on the
day of party. In this project what we are focusing on implementing is a web platform to reduce
human efforts and time consumption in organizing a party. In our work we are proposing a
system based on web services. In this project user related information is stored in database and
retrieved whenever required.
Software and Technology Required-:
For Designing -: CSS and Bootstrap
For scripting-: HTML, pHp and JavaScript
In this project modules that could be included are-:
• Signup
• Log in
• Invite page
• Response page
• User Dashboard that would display previous parties, future parties
 o Here we could also show an analysis of how many people came on you party
with how many invites send out so that you can get a prediction of how many might come, or
what are the possibility of a particular person coming to you party.
• Family tree
Inside user login:
• Home
• Events
• Invites
• Family tree
• Friends
• Notification
• Sign out
• Account settings
At time of login there arises three cases-:
 Case 1: if they are login in for first time the they should be able to select their relatives.
Request will be made to another user so that they could confirm and let them add him or
her to their family tree.
 Case 2: they have just login for first time and they want to invite some X person to party
they know on the platform they can send them friend request as well as invitation.
• Now X can accept or reject invitation and friend request interpedently, either one
either both or non.
 If X accepts the friend request then he/she has to confirm the relationship with the person
who has send request.
• Which leads us to a second category if a person is only friend the we need to have
separate friends’ tree if we might think so. (if we do generate friend tree then it should be centric
tree visualization where root will be in middle instead of top).
 Case 3: if he is a regular user the we need to decide what we can display as home screen
dashboard.
 o Dashboard will display details like what parties have you visited in past, what invitations
you have excepted (which will be displayed as parties on)
 o What are pending invitation that you need to reply to.
o Also, one of the most import part of accepting invitation is to mention how many people
can host expect. So that he can plan party accordingly
Family Tree-:
 Here we wish to implement a visualization of family tree of every person. It will
represent how you are related to someone else.
 o It will basically have levels. For instance, consider you, your brothers and sisters
at the bottom level, then next level will be of your parents, up to which will be your
grandparents.
 If person has an account on website then they could be linked through that family tree.
 This might also be used in later stage to combine family trees of many persons to
generate a bigger picture.
